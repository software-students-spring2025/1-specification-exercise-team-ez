## Stakeholder Interviews

### Interviewees
- **Nemo Weng**: Nemo is a competitive swimmer and weightlifter, interested in optimizing his training and performance across both disciplines.
- **Jiayi Yu**: Jiayi is a marathon runner focused on enhancing her endurance training and nutritional planning through targeted app features.

### Goals and Needs
1. **Increase Muscle Mass**: Both interviewees aim to increase their muscle mass, which requires frequent and targeted workouts.
2. **Develop Good Daily Routines**: They want to integrate fitness seamlessly into their daily lives without compromising their academic and social activities.
3. **Maintain a Regular Diet**: Consistent fitness routines help in maintaining a regular diet, which is crucial for their overall health and fitness goals.
4. **Efficient Time Management**: They prefer to maximize their workout time by minimizing travel and wait times at the gym.

### Problems and Frustrations
1. **Crowdedness of Gyms**: Uncertainties about gym capacity and equipment availability often disrupt their workout plans and lead to hygiene concerns.
2. **Inefficient Scheduling**: The inability to know the crowdedness of the gym in real-time makes it difficult to plan workouts effectively around their classes and social activities.
3. **Time Wasted Waiting for Equipment**: Significant time is lost waiting for equipment due to high gym traffic, especially after class hours.
4. **Inconvenient Gym Event Reservations**: The current web-based reservation system is not user-friendly, lacks filtering options, and does not facilitate an easy reservation process for specific gym events and classes that students are interested in.

### Desired App Features
- **Real-time Gym Traffic Updates**: An app feature that shows the current crowdedness of each gym could help them decide the best time and gym location to go to.
- **Equipment Availability Status**: Knowing which equipment is available in real-time would reduce waiting times and improve workout efficiency.
- **Multi-Gym Equipment Guide**: Suggestions for alternative gyms with the necessary equipment available when their preferred gym is too crowded.
- **Enhanced Gym Event Booking**: An integrated feature in the app that allows for easy reservation of gym events and classes, complete with advanced filtering options to quickly find the events that match the student's interests and schedule.

## Product Vision Statement
As an NYU student, I want an app that provides real-time updates on gym crowdedness to optimize my workout and provide event reservations.

## User Requirements
### User Stories
- As a fitness enthusiast, I want to choose between weight training and cardio so that I can select the type of workout that suits my goals.
- As a cardio enthusiast, I want to find the school gym where cardio equipment is most available, so I can save time.
- As an anaerobic exercise enthusiast, I want to find a gym with the most fixed equipment so that the likelihood of injury during exercise is reduced.
- As a user interested in targeted strength training, I want to find the gym with the most equipment for my target muscle groups so that I can have a better training outcome and experience.
- As a running enthusiast, I want to select the cardio option (treadmill) so that I can check which gym is available.
- As a student, I want to view a visual representation (color bar) of how busy each gym is so that I can plan my workout when the gym is less crowded.
- As a user, I want to select my preferred gym based on current crowd data so that I can avoid overly busy environments.
- As someone focused on abs training, I want to check the crowd level for the abs area so that I can choose a quieter time to practice.

- As a student, I want to easily reserve spots for gym classes and events through the app so that I can plan my fitness activities without navigating cumbersome websites or dealing with unavailable options.
